                        I have worn many hats but they all revolve around software and technology.
                        Programming has always been something I find fascinating. Seeing what can be done or improving on an existing design is one of my favorite aspects.
                        I especially enjoy collaborating with others to create something wonderful.
                        Whether it be a video game, application, or a system I love what I do and I take pride in my work. I always strive to keep up to date and learn new things.
